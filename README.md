AniCommand by Joseph Jacir

A collection of JSFL commands and an SWF Panel to serve as a GUI for them.

These streamline the animation workflow in Adobe Flash, especially for the production of HTML5 animations.

Help docs are included in this repo, but hosted here:

These scripts should be installed in the Flash Commands folder, and the SWF should be installed in the WindowSWF folder. More detailed installation instructions are at the above link.
